# HELLO-FOSS-Intro to ML
Hello There!
This project is a part of HELLO-FOSS: Celebration of Open Source by the Web and Coding Club. We will be focusing on building basic ML models.
The slides for the Introductory Workshop on Machine Learning can be found <a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UKiMZTcnCOUxNHcBNnSd-n6FCgyZYEldMT--3h0nzok/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>

## Guidelines
Absolutely No Prerequisites for contributing to this Project.
We will be using Jupyter Notebooks for our Project. If you are an absolute beginner in python have a look at [this](https://github.com/wncc/learners-space/tree/master/Python).

**NOTE: before sending any pull request, rename your file to include your initials as - `<filename>_<roll_number>.<extension>`.**

## Quiz on Basics of Machine Learning

 **Task 1**: Try to solve these [**MCQ's**](https://forms.gle/UNLr1X793j2X2giT7) to check your grasp on the basics of Machine Learning.

# Housing Problem
Everyone finally comes back to campus in their 3rd year after spending their first 4 semesters online and are really excited to know their parent hostels. But  to everyones shock IITB association and the hostel council has completely changed the rules
Now we don't get our hostels alloted to us, now we have the liberty to choose our own hostel among hostel 1,2,3 which are at different distnaces from the lecture complex and hence have different living costs. Now the rooms aren't just double occupancy. Now 1,2,3 people can stay in a room and respectively all the rooms have different sizes and different costs.


## Task
**Task 2**:  Now to make her choice and to get a room, Shruti visits all the hostels but the hostel managers are not on duty that day. So based on the data Shruti has, she has to predict the cost of the rooms shown [here](Hostel_Linear_Dataset.csv) to decide her room.

Here the factors will be hostel, occupancy, room area and floor for the price of the room.

# SK Learn Implementation Tasks
**Task 3**: You will have to perform Logisitic Regression and Decision Tree Algorithm on the [Iris](iris.csv) Dataset using Sklearn Library. You are free to change the hyperparameters or try out other algorithms like Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Classifier (part of Support Vector Machines) to get better results. 

**Task 4**: Learning KNN's from notebook given and then performing classification using KNN's on the [Iris](iris.csv) Dataset
