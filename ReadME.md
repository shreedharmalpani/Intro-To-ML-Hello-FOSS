## Guidelines
To contribute to these projects you should have a basic grasp on Python. You can go through [these resources](https://github.com/wncc/TSS-2021/tree/main/Python%20%26%20its%20Applications/Week-1) if you want to learn Python. <br>

## Tasks

 - Task 1 : MCQ's
 - Task 2 : Linear Regression <br> <p>Everyone finally comes back to campus in their 3rd year after spending their first 4 semesters online and are really excited to know their parent hostels. But  to everyones shock IITB association and the hostel council has completely changed the rules

      Now we don't get our hostels alloted to us, now we have the liberty to choose our own hostel among hostel 1,2,3 which are at different distnaces from the lecture complex and hence have different living costs

      Now the rooms aren't just double occupancy
      Now 1,2,3 people can stay in a room and respectively all the rooms have different sizes and different costs

      Now to make her choice and to get a room, Shruti visits all the hostels but the hostel managers are not on duty that day. So based on the data Shruti has, she has to predict the cost the rooms shown [here](Hostel_Linear_Dataset.csv) to decide her room

      Here the factors will be hostel, occupancy, room area and floor for the price of the room</p>
      Use the notebook given to perform regression on the given dataset and decide the room that Shruti should choose
 - Task 3 : Logistic Regression <br> <p> You will have to perform Logisitic Regression and Decision Tree Algorithm on the [Iris](iris.csv) Dataset using Sklearn Framework.
            You are free to change the hyperparameters or try out other algorithms like Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Classifier (part of Support Vector Machines) to get better results. 
  - Task 4 : Learning KNN's from notebook given and then performing classification usin KNN's on the [Iris](iris.csv) Dataset
